# create_a_doc_chatbot

### Aim
In this lesson, we will create a chatbot that learns from a large document and can answer queries based on that document. We face an issue where the existing language model (llm) is unable to effectively answer queries about the specific document. We will address this issue by developing a chatbot that can understand and retrieve information from the document, enabling it to provide accurate responses to our queries.
